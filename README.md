# Frontend Uberr client built with React Native and Expo.
Please note that some ISPs might block access to a few GitHub domains. In that case, use any trusted VPN or DNS to access the same. I use CloudFlare Warp at times and [AdGuard Public DNS](https://adguard-dns.io/en/public-dns.html) (_always on_).
# Installation
1. Clone
2. Run `npm i`
3. Replace some assets with your own files. The only local assets are the image files used inside the OFFERS component.
